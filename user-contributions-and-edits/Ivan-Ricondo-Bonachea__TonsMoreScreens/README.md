Based on your telemetry script, I have added some things:

- Take all the data from telemetry (not receiver switches)
- Add more screens in the same script (right now I have 4 screen: prearm, postarm, drone recover screen, and a static help screen, you can switch from one screen to another using + and - buttons)
- I use timer1 for counting time from 0 (not a countdown)
- Unfortunately I have a X9D, and some of the screens are optimized for this (but keep X7)
- Unfortunately, comments are in spanish (I'm from spain, and it is easier for me to write in spanish)
- Unfortunately, I have reached the maximum size of the script (I have changed and optimized some things to make it lighter, and I suppose I can not add much more things... I was adding an artificial horizon line, but not finished, for example.
